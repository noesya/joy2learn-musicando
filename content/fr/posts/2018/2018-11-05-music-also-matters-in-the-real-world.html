        <p><a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/edward-r-howe-541520">Edward R. Howe</a>, <em><a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/thompson-rivers-university-2586">Thompson Rivers University</a>, </em></p><p><em><br></em><em>The Conversation<br></em><br></p><p>Full self-disclosure — I’m a “bandie !”</p><p>  </p><p>In junior high school, band provided me with a safe haven during the challenging years of adolescence. Band was essential to my emerging identity and to building my self-confidence. </p><p>  </p><p>But wait, didn’t I become a physics teacher, and then a teacher educator in a teaching program focused on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)? Double yes. </p><p>  </p><p>Music helped me gain the confidence and grit to pursue my dreams and to reach my full potential. I came to realize that science and music are complementary, not contradictory. </p><p>  </p><p>Verge of extinction</p><p>  </p><p>But band is on the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-schools-music-education-1.4114622">verge of extinction in many schools</a>. Students, parents and administrators increasingly see band as a “frill.” Music education is being <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-schools-music-education-1.4114622">drastically cut</a> and is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/10/music-disappearing-school-curriculum-england-survey-gcse-a-level">not valued</a> by many as it once was. </p><p>  </p><p>The trend can be traced to the “back to basics” movement fuelled by neoliberalism, and in particular the seminal 1983 U.S. report <a href="http://neatoday.org/2013/04/25/a-nation-at-risk-turns-30-where-did-it-take-us-2/">A Nation at Risk</a>. </p><p>  </p><p>In Canada, we don’t have to look far to see the impact of misguided government policies framed by the rhetoric of <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4330893/doug-ford-ontario-1998-sex-ed-curriculum-teachers/">“back to basics” movements in education</a>. In many regions, the education pendulum has swung decidedly back to “traditional” ways of learning <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17508487.2013.776990">that in effect has narrowed the curriculum</a>.</p><p>  </p><p>Amid a neoliberal/neoconservative climate of “practical” and “evidence-based” schooling, even <a href="http://files.rc.mu/Examinations/2018/Files/Mar21/Benefits-Music-Education/Benefits-of-Music-Education.html">The Royal Conservatory of Music</a> highlights neuroscientific research demonstrating the many benefits of music. </p><p>  </p><p>But efforts to encourage music lessons may largely stand to benefit students from wealthier families whose parents can pay for extra-curricular activities. Unfortunately, the recent changes to our British Columbia curriculum might not happen in time to save our music programs in schools. </p><p>  </p><p>‘There is nobody judging me’</p><p>  </p><p>That’s a shame. In Canada, we pride ourselves on providing excellent public education for all, regardless of socioeconomic status. A recent comprehensive meta-study clearly shows that <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/0002831217701830">fine arts education positively influences child development</a>. If music is a “frill,” and not accessible to all income brackets, children from poorer families will not have the opportunity to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01777/full">benefit from what may be music’s boost to literacy, fine motor skills and spatial reasoning in the early years</a>.</p><p>  </p><p>For youth, music contributes to development of an individual’s emerging self-identity, and can shape <a href="https://www.apa.org/research/action/speaking-of-psychology/music-health.aspx">mental health</a> and our future. This could be one reason the Coalition for Music Education says that as much as we learn to make music, <a href="https://www.musicmakesus.ca/">music makes us</a>. </p><p>  </p><p>Most importantly, as demonstrated in my research, music education <a href="https://www.kamloopsmusiccollective.info/forum/40-years-40-stories">has made a huge impact on the lives of many individuals</a>. In an age of scrutiny, music offers <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/canajeducrevucan.34.3.317.pdf">a host of other benefits</a> and a safe space for children. </p><p>  </p><p>A 10-year-old participant in our study said : </p><p>  </p><p>“[Going to music camp] is better than school. At school I am quiet and reserved because I get bullied for being different. When I am here, I can express myself easily because there is nobody judging me. We are all the same and share a love for music which makes it easy to interact with others.”</p><p>  </p><p>Another participant (aged 13) said :</p><p>  </p><p>“[Going to music camp] helped me to keep an open mind to trying new things and helped to build my confidence, especially as I navigated a new role for High School Musical where I was unsure my role… I think it will help me be a better student next year.”</p><p>  </p><p>Yet what I’ve seen in my own son’s school mirrors larger trends : A band program completely relegated to outside the regular timetable. Students are opting out of band because it is not offered during regular school hours and it is seen as a “frill.” </p><p>  </p><p>The rationale is that the fine arts are not as important as academic subjects such as English, math and the sciences. But without the <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0255761410370658">social, psychological, cultural and self-regulatory</a> benefits of music or other arts, what kind of students are we raising, and how to we expect them to thrive in the world ?</p><p>  </p><p>Teaching to the test</p><p>  </p><p>British Columbia has only recently shown signs of <a href="https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca">holistic thinking</a> with the introduction of a new K-12 curriculum. The focus is on core competencies like thinking and communication rather than an exhaustive list of learning outcomes. </p><p>  </p><p>While some Canadian provinces are mandating “<a href="https://www.canadianliving.com/life-and-relationships/family/article/the-future-of-standardized-testing-in-canada">teaching to the test</a>,” B.C. is doing away with exams measuring a limited amount of knowledge and moving towards a more balanced approach to learning. These educational reforms are based on current educational research and best practices.</p><p>  </p><p>What can be done to support and encourage music education for all ? I hope the discussion is not marginalized by STEM, but can develop alongside our concerns for STEM education. Because just like <a href="https://tru.arcabc.ca/islandora/object/tru%3A1984">gaining digital skills</a>, music matters. </p><p>  </p><p><em>I wish to thank my Research Assistant, Allysha Sorba, for her work on my music research project.</em><img></p><p>  </p><p><a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/edward-r-howe-541520">Edward R.
